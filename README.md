**Will be available for a few days only**

Jupyter Notebook on how to use PyTorch to approximate functions with neural networks and solve PDE

+ Intro to PyTorch
+ Intro to automatic differentiation
+ Intro to gradient-based optimization
+ Intro to PINN (physics-informed neural network)
+ PINN for simple inverse problem

There is also a Python script with content equivalent to the notebook, it will create all the figures at once though.

### Requirements 

Numpy, Matplotlib, Torch, Jupyter
